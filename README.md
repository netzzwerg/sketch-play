## Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of Sketch installed. **(Sketch 40+)**

1. [Download the ZIP file of this repository](https://github.com/sureskumar/sketch-play/archive/master.zip)
2. Double click on `Sketch-Play.sketchplugin`

## How to use:
1. Create an artboard larger than 300px width and height.
2. Draw rectangles on the artboard: These rectangles convert into bricks. (only RECTANGLES are supported at the moment).
3. Name the artboard: This becomes the caption for your game.
4. Select the artboard and click 'Plugins > Sketch Play'. (cmd + J)

Fill color of the rectangles and artboard will be used while creating the breakout game.

Note: This is a proof of concept plugin for using Sketch app to create gameplays. It only supports ‘Breakout’ game at the moment. I will be adding more games very soon.
