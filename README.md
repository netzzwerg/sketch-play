Create game plays directly from Sketch app.

## How to use:
1. Create an artboard larger than 300px width and height.
2. Draw rectangles on the upper ⅔ of the artboard: These rectangles becomes the bricks. (only RECTANGLES are supported at the moment).
3. Hit ‘Play’ from Plugins > Sketch Play. (cmd + j)

Fill color of the rectangles and artboard will be used while creating the breakout game.

Note: This is a proof of concept plugin for using Sketch app to create web game plays. It only supports ‘Breakout’ game at the moment. I will be adding more games very soon.
